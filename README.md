## **Project Description**  

The goal of this project is to predict Airbnb listing prices in Barcelona. The workflow includes **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify the most important features, **feature engineering**, and building a machine learning model with fine-tuning to improve performance.  

This project is particularly helpful for Airbnb hosts looking to optimize their pricing strategy and for guests to better understand rental price ranges.

## **Steps Performed**

1. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Removed missing values, duplicates, and outliers.  
   - Standardized and organized data for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Analyzed and visualized the dataset to identify the most impactful parameters for price prediction.  

3. **Feature Engineering**:  
   - Converted non-numeric values (e.g., property types, amenities) into numeric values using encoding techniques.  
   - Normalized features to ensure a balanced input for model training.  

4. **Model Training and Fine-Tuning**:  
   - Trained various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).  
   - Fine-tuned hyperparameters to improve accuracy and reduce errors.

## **Technologies Used**  

- **Pandas**: Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Data visualization and EDA  
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning model building and fine-tuning
- **Excel VBA**: For Minimal Cleaning of the dataset
